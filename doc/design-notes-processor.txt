The processor module is designed as an accessory board for a Gumstix
Overo Air. (Although it will be physically larger then the Overo.) The
connector pinout is described by Gumstix documentation an drawn into
the symbols overo-J*-1.sym. The schematic sheets that are named with
the prefix "processor_" are sheets of the processor board.

* processor_lan

This page describes the ethernet LAN. Ethernet support uses the
LAN9221 ASIC from SMSC and a Pulse StarJack J00-00XXNL series
jack. The J00-0045NL or J00-0065NL should do as a jack. The speed and
link lights are integrated into the jack.

The address lines are wired up like the Gumstix Chestnut board for
software compatibility. In particular, A10 is used as a FIFO_SEL so
the processor address range matches what the Overo expects.
