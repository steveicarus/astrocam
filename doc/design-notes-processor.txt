The processor module is designed as an accessory board for a Gumstix
Overo Air. (Although it will be physically larger then the Overo.) The
connector pinout is described by Gumstix documentation an drawn into
the symbols overo-J*-1.sym. The schematic sheets that are named with
the prefix "processor_" are sheets of the processor board.

* processor_lan

This page describes the ethernet LAN. Ethernet support uses the
LAN9221 ASIC from SMSC and a Pulse StarJack J00-00XXNL series
jack. The J00-0045NL or J00-0065NL should do as a jack. The speed and
link lights are integrated into the jack.

The address lines are wired up like the Gumstix Chestnut board for
software compatibility. In particular, A10 is used as a FIFO_SEL so
the processor address range matches what the Overo expects.

* processor_logic

The processor_logic symbol describes the FPGA that handles the
interface to the remote camera. The FPGA connects to the processor
peripheral bus, the processor camera interface, and the SerDes
interface.

The FPGA is mostly clocked by a 40MHz system clock, input to the
SYSCLK pin. The video output and serdes interfaces are synchronous with
this clock. The same clock drives the SYSCLK input, the SerDes TCLK,
and the pixel clock into the Overo.

The processor interface uses the BUS CLOCK that comes from the Overo
processor board. Address and data are multiplexed on a 16bit bus with
address enable, write enable, output enable, byte enables and chip
select.

The FPGA should be configured as slave parallel, and wired in such a
way that writes into the chip select for the FPGA can load the FPGA.
